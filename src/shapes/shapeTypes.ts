/**
 * Simple shape drawing (patterns) — project plan §17 "画笔/图案" 的轻量子集。
 *
 * A drawn shape is not a new kind of layer: it is generated as a one-path SVG
 * document and imported as a normal `svg` layer asset. Everything downstream
 * (occlusion, both preview modes, PNG export, SVG vector export, recolouring,
 * project saving) therefore works without special cases, and the project file
 * format is unchanged.
